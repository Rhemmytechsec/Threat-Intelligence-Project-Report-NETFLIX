# Threat-Intelligence-Project-Report-NETFLIX
Author: Remi Adeparusi
Focus: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) & OSINT Analysis
Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) methodologies using publicly available Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT). The analysis focuses on identifying potential threat actors, attack techniques, and organizational exposure.
Objectives

Conduct passive OSINT collection

Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)

Map observed techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework

Analyze command-and-control (C2) techniques

Assess overall security posture
Tools Used

OSINT Framework

VirusTotal

Shodan

WHOIS Lookup

MITRE ATT&CK Framework

Public breach databases
Key Findings

Identified potential phishing infrastructure patterns

Observed use of web-based command & control techniques

Mapped attacker behavior to relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics

Highlighted areas of potential organizational exposure
