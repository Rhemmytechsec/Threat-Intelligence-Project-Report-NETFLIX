# Threat-Intelligence-Project-Report-NETFLIX
Author: Remi Adeparusi
Focus: Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) & OSINT Analysis
## Project overview
This project demonstrates the application of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) methodologies using publicly available Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT). The analysis focuses on identifying potential threat actors, attack techniques, and organizational exposure.
## objectives
-Conduct passive OSINT collection
-Identify indicators of compromise (IOCs)
-Map observed techniques to the MITRE ATT&CK framework
-Analyze command-and-control (C2) techniques
-Assess overall security posture

## Tools used
-The Harvester
-VirusTotal
-Shodan
-WHOIS
-Google dorks
-wayback machine
-Mxtoolbox
-URLScan.io
-ABUSEIP
-Have i been pwned
-MITRE ATT&CK Framework

## Key findings
-Identified potential phishing infrastructure patterns
-Observed use of web-based command & control techniques
-Mapped attacker behavior to relevant MITRE ATT&CK tactics
-Highlighted areas of potential organizational exposure
## Skills Demonstrated
-Threat Intelligence Analysis
- Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)
- MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
